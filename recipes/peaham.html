    <h2>What is Pea & Ham Soup?</h2>
    <p>The name says it all. It is a staple dish in many cuisines and cultures. It is thought to have originated from Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome and as far back as 500-400 BCE.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>~750g ham bone</li>
        <li>1.5 cups of green split peas</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 cloves of crushed garlic</li>
        <li>2 carrots chopped</li>
        <li>2 sticks celery trimmed chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion chopped</li>
        <li>6 cups of water</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to season</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse split peas under cold running water until water runs clear. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, onion and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until the onion softens.</li>
        <li>Add split peas, ham bone and water. Bring to the boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 2 - 2 1/2 hours or until ham hocks are tender and the meat is falling away from the bones. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool slightly. Remove ham hocks from

        <li>Place one-quarter of the pea mixture in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Return to pan with ham.
